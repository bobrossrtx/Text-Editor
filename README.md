# Text Editor

The Text Editor is a simple and easy to use enviroment for writng documents or maybe even code.
It is a text editor and source code editor for use under Microsoft Windows. It supports around 30
programming languages.

Although it is not truely recomended for development or heavy programming, it is at most capable of doing most
programming tasks. The main limitations to the idea of using this text editor as your main programming tool is the lack of IDE conveniences
listing from: No console, No built in terminal, No syntax highlighting, No error detection. Like said, the editor is not made for coding but is
fully able to.

The main intent for the text editor is to have a quick and fast way to type out notes, scripts, letters, emails or many more plain text files.
The simple design keeps many distractions from flying in and taking over your perspective and to not clutter your screen taking up any more
video memory than it needs.
